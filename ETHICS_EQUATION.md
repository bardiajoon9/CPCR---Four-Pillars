# ETHICS_EQUATION.md — Gating Lens, Not a Scoreboard

CPCR uses an ethics equation as a conceptual lens for what must be disclosed before any claim can be treated as ethically computable.

```text
Er = ((T × H) + R) / N − M
```

Where, at a high level:

- `T` = Transparency (CTGS)
- `H` = Human integrity protections (HRIS)
- `R` = Identity continuity / branching impact (NITT)
- `N` = Nefarious intent or exploitative risk penalty
- `M` = Material / physical externality constraints (PLANT)

Important:

- Variables need not be literal numbers; they represent structured disclosures and constraints.
- Unresolved variables force UNDETERMINED outcomes. CPCR does not invent values to make Er look nice.
- The equation is a gate, not a KPI. It is about whether a claim may advance, not how “good” it is.

## Ethical Risk Index (state-based, not numeric)

Instead of numeric scores, CPCR reports an Ethical Risk Index using discrete states:

- `COMPUTABLE` — All required disclosures present and structurally coherent.
- `UNDETERMINED` — One or more required variables missing or withheld.
- `REFUSED` — Structural incompatibility with CPCR invariants (e.g., non-verifiable survival claims).
- `DEGRADED` — Partial scope only; advisory analysis with explicit caveats.

These states are recorded in the CPCR conflict record (see the JSON Schema) and may be surfaced in public reporting.
