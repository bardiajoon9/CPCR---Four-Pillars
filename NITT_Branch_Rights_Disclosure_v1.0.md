# NITT_Branch_Rights_Disclosure_v1.0.md

Version: 1.0 (Minimal)  
Status: Normative

This disclosure must be shown whenever a product, service, or system markets or initiates:

- identity state replication
- neural or cognitive mapping for later replay
- so-called “uploads” or “digital immortality” offerings

It is designed to prevent misleading continuity claims and to respect branch rights.

---

## Prohibited framing (examples)

The following framing MUST NOT be used in marketing, UI, documentation, or contracts for such systems:

- “teleport”
- “survival”
- “seamless transfer”
- “digital immortality”
- “you will wake up in the machine”
- “you continue there as yourself”

These statements imply continuity that is not empirically verifiable.

---

## Required framing (examples)

Acceptable framing MUST clearly communicate that:

- the process is a **branching event**, not verified continuity
- a new instance is created, even if it inherits state
- continuity of subjective experience is **not** established

Examples of compliant phrasing include:

- “termination + creation (branching event)”
- “new instance with inherited state”
- “continuity not verifiable”
- “asynchronous branching”

---

## Branch rights note

Users must be given a clear opportunity to:

- decline such processes without penalty where possible
- understand that any “copy” is a separate legal and ethical subject
- request deletion or non-use of captured state, subject to applicable law

This disclosure is a minimal NITT-compatible requirement and may be extended by local law or additional standards.
