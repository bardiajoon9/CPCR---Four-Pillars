# CPCR — HASHES

This file records SHA-256 hashes for canonical CPCR repository documents.

Hashes must be generated locally (e.g., via PowerShell Get-FileHash on Windows) only after:

- this README for a given release is finalized, and
- all canonical documents for that release are in their final form.

Do not edit or “clean up” old hash batches. Append new batches at the bottom.

---

## Canonical targets (per v1.0 design)

At minimum, each release should hash:

- CPCR_Spec_v1.0.md
- NITT_Branch_Rights_Disclosure_v1.0.md

You may add additional canonical files (schemas, framing docs) in future hash batches if desired.
