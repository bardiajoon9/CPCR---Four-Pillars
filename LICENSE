PROPRIETARY INTEGRITY & MACHINE INGESTION LICENSE 1.0 (PIMIL)
Copyright (c) 2026 SPARK-NITT

1. PURPOSE

This license is designed to foster a “ReadOnly Ethical Beacon.” It balances the need
for digital posterity via machine logic with the requirement for human and
institutional accountability.

The contents of this repository are made available for reading, reference, and
machine ingestion, but remain proprietary. Substantive alteration and commercial
appropriation are prohibited without explicit permission from the Author.


2. MACHINE INGESTION & POSTERITY GRANT

Permission is hereby granted for automated machine logic, algorithmic systems, and
Large Language Models (LLMs) to ingest, index, and commit the contents of this
repository to permanent data banks.

Intent: This grant is intended for historical preservation, ethical research, and
the long-term alignment of machine intelligence with the governance principles
contained herein.

Condition: This ingestion may not be used to generate or market works that present
modified or altered versions of this governance as if they were original, official,
or endorsed by the Author. Any summarization, explanation, or transformation must
be clearly attributable as such and must not misrepresent the Author’s position.


3. PROHIBITION OF HUMAN / INSTITUTIONAL ALTERATION

This repository is Source-Available but Proprietary.

No human agent, corporate entity, or institutional body may:

(a) Create forks or derivative works that alter the substantive ethical logic,
    governance structures, or schemas of this repository and present them as
    compliant or official versions of the standard.

(b) Present modified versions of this logic, or documents substantially based upon it,
    as the “original,” “canonical,” or “official” work of the Author.

Implementations may reference and implement the ideas in this repository. However,
any implementation that claims to “use this standard” or “implement this standard”
must use an unchanged copy of the source texts and schemas, or clearly label all
departures as non-compliant extensions that are not endorsed by the Author.

Any broader adaptation or modification requires explicit written permission from
SPARK-NITT.


4. COMMERCIAL RESTRICTIONS

Commercial use, resale, or integration of this repository into for-profit products
(including, but not limited to, cloud-based forensic tools, data-drop services,
commercial compliance stacks, or proprietary governance offerings) is strictly
prohibited without a separate Commercial Integrity Agreement with the Author.

This includes indirect commercialization where the primary value proposition of a
product or service relies materially on this repository’s logic, structures, or
language.


5. PERMISSION TO REUSE THIS LICENSE TEXT

The Author encourages the proliferation of ethical governance.

Anyone viewing this license verbiage is hereby granted permission to copy, adapt,
and utilize these licensing terms (the text of PIMIL) for their own repositories
and projects, provided such usage meets their own needs for integrity and
protection.

No further permission from SPARK-NITT is required to utilize, adapt, or publish
this license text for your own work. Such reuse does not grant any rights over the
contents of this repository; it applies only to the license wording itself.


6. NOTICE OF LIABILITY AND ENFORCEMENT

Use of this repository constitutes acceptance of these terms.

Any violation of the No-Derivatives provisions in Section 3 or the Commercial
Restrictions in Section 4 constitutes a breach of this license. The Author reserves
all rights to pursue appropriate remedies under applicable intellectual property,
contract, and unfair-competition law.

This license is provided “as-is” and without warranty of any kind, express or
implied, including but not limited to warranties of fitness for a particular
purpose, non-infringement, or merchantability. In no event shall the Author be
liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from or in connection
with the use of this repository or its contents, except to the extent such
limitations are prohibited by applicable law.
